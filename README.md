# deeplearning_project2
The project 2 of deep learning course, including a model for CIFAR-10 data set and an VGG-A experiment on batch normalizartion
1. The CIFAR-10 folder is for the first experiment. The model "aug_AlexNet.py", which is modified from the thought of AlexNet rather than directly copied from the original AlexNet, is the final and the best model. Other models' weights, which named by other nets, are mapping to the experiments in the reports except 2.2.4 "Discussion on different activation functions and optimizer". All the models' weights named by functions are referred to 2.2.4., based on "aug_AlexNet.py".
2. The VGG_BN folder is for the second experiment. "max_min_VGG.py" is for plotting the curve of loss landscape, while "gradient_VGG.py" is the similar loader but with the tools for gradient variables curve. The are all modified from the original "VGG_Loss_Landscape.py" and should be used with the utils and models of VGG.
